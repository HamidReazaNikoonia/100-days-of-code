# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 7, 2018 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Joined #100DaysOfCode Challenge

**Thoughts:** After getting my Responsive Web Design Certification on freeCodeCamp, I wanted to take my learning journey to the next level. After seeing so much positivity and progress with #100DaysOfCode challengers, I decided to join myself!

### Day 2: September 8, 2018 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Reworked For Loop modules in freeCodeCamp's Bosic JavaScript section of the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification curriculum.

**Thoughts**: Haven't hit a code wall this big to date. The logic in these concepts are difficult compared to learning HTML and CSS. Watching YouTube videos with explanations on these modules are helpful. Reading tweets about other people saying you're never really "stuck" if you keep going back to it and outting in the time to learn, so I'm doing just that until I get it right.

### Day 3: September 9, 2018 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Did some updates to my personal online portfolio. Also, wrote a detailed S.M.A.R.T. plan for coding, health/fitness, blogging and networking goals. Today is the day I started logging #100DaysOfCode progress in this GitHub repo. 

**Thoughts**: I'm very optimistic about the journey of participating in this challenge. I believe it will help shape me into a well-rounded coder and hopefully full-time Front-end Engineer.

### Day 4: September 10, 2018 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finally got passed the Basic JavaScript section in freeCodeCamp and am making progress on the ES6 modules. I also finished up the "Why Joing #100DaysOfCoding" blog post on Medium. 

**Thoughts**: Kind of hit a code wall while learning For Loop and working through the Record Collection and Profile Lookup modules. Will be circling back to these periodically until the logic behind each module is understood.

### Day 5: September 11, 2018 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the destructuring modules in ES6. Having a little trouble grasping the concept here so I;ve been reworking the modules. Also, made a GitHub repo to track my progress/code solutions as I work through freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: It's frustrating not being able to grasp a concept within a matter of minutes after reading the module description and example. I think this is usually the case for people brand new to coding. Just keeping my head down and working through it.

### Day 6: September 12, 2018 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the ES6 section of the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures section. Reviewed some earlier modules in the morning at jury duty (thank goodness I wasn't selected). Came back to my apartment, napped and afterwards, finished ES6.

**Thoughts**: I didn't realize how fast I flew by ES6 until I looked at when I finished the Basic JavaScript section on this log and in my personal calendars.

### Day 7: September 13, 2018 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Only completed 7 modules in the Regular Expressions section. Had a phone interview with 4Media but declined furthering the interview process because the position called for working exclusively in the adult entertainment industry. They mentioned the position was offering $55k max, but did not extend and offer because I declined the opportunity.

**Thoughts**: Used most of the afternoon prepping for the phone interview. Felt great to get my feel wet interviewing for a front-end position. Unfortunately, I had to pass on the opportunity.

### Day 8: September 14, 2018 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Figured out how to rename a folder and transfer the files within that folder to the new renamed folder in GitHub. Will be doing a few modules in freeCodeCamp later tonight to complete my hour of code for the challenge.

**Thoughts**: Was nice to work on something else code besides freeCodeCamp. Going to do my best to make more videos like this.

### Day 9: September 15, 2018 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Redid the Regular Expressions modules from the start for a refresher and finished a couple more modules after. Logged challenges into the freeCodeCamp solutions repository.

**Thoughts**: Planning to be done with the rest of the Regular Expressions modules by tomorrow night - maybe will do some tonight. Today, I'm going to get some much needed sunshine!
