# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 7, 2018 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Joined #100DaysOfCode Challenge

**Thoughts:** After getting my Responsive Web Design Certification on freeCodeCamp, I wanted to take my learning journey to the next level. After seeing so much positivity and progress with #100DaysOfCode challengers, I decided to join myself!

### Day 2: September 8, 2018 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Reworked For Loop modules in freeCodeCamp's Bosic JavaScript section of the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification curriculum.

**Thoughts**: Haven't hit a code wall this big to date. The logic in these concepts are difficult compared to learning HTML and CSS. Watching YouTube videos with explanations on these modules are helpful. Reading tweets about other people saying you're never really "stuck" if you keep going back to it and outting in the time to learn, so I'm doing just that until I get it right.

### Day 3: September 9, 2018 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Did some updates to my personal online portfolio. Also, wrote a detailed S.M.A.R.T. plan for coding, health/fitness, blogging and networking goals. Today is the day I started logging #100DaysOfCode progress in GitHub. 

**Thoughts**: I'm very optimistic about the journey of participating in this challenge. I believe it will help shape me into a well-rounded coder and hopefully full-time Front-end Engineer.
